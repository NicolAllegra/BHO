# Chess Saliency Dataset
We has 3 Chess experts annotate a 100 Chess puzzle positions with pieces they deemed important in each of these. We used this dataset to compare the saliency output of our method with what experts actually pay attention to. We discovered SARFA to be the most accurate technique to highlight salient peices in Chess positions. 

This dataset is uploaded to our code repository and can be found [at this URL](https://github.com/nikaashpuri/sarfa-saliency/tree/master/chess_saliency_databases). We plan to continue maintaining and expanding this dataset. We hope this will be a useful contribution for further research in the field.
